### what is control plane?
The orchestration layer that exposes API and interfaces to define, deploy & manage lifecycle of the containers.

### Control plane components
- The control plane components make global decisions about the cluster (Ex: scheduling), as well as detecting and responding to the cluster events(Ex : Starting a new pod when deployment's replicas field is unsatisfied)
- Control plane components can be run on any machine in the cluster. However, for simplicity, setup scripts typically start all CPC on the same machine, and do not run user containers on this machine. 

#### kube-apiserver
The API server is a component of the k8s control plane that exposes the kubernetes API. The API server is the front end of the K8s Control plane. 
The kube-apiserver is designed to scale horizontally.

#### etcd
- Consistent & highly-available key value store used as k8's backing store for all cluster data. 

#### kube-scheduler
- Control plane component that watches for newly created Pods with no assigned node, and selects a node for them to run on.

#### kube-controller-manager
- Control plane component that runs controller processes. Logically each controller is a separate process, but to reduce complexity, they are all compiled into a single binary and run in a single process. 
- Some of these controllers are 
	- **Node Controller** : Responsible for noticing and responding when node goes down.
	- **Job Controller** : Watches for job objects that represent one-off tasks, then creates Pods to run those tasks to completion.
	- **Endpoints Controller** : Populates the endpoints objects. 
	- **Service Account & Token Controllers** : Create default accounts and API access tokens for new namespaces.

#### cloud-controller-manager
- CCM is the control plane component that embeds cloud specific control logic. The cloud controller manger lets you link your cluster into your cloud Provider's API, and separates out the components that interact with that cloud platform from components that only interact with your cluster.
- The cloud controller manager only runs controllers that are specific to your cloud provider. If you are running Kubernetes on your own premises, or in a learning environment inside your own PC, the cluster does not have a cloud controller manager.
- As with kube-controller-manager, the cloud-controller-manager combines several logically independent control loops into a single binary that you run as a single process. You can scale horizontally to improve performance or to help tolerate facilities.

The following controllers can have cloud provider dependencies :
- Node controller : For checking the cloud provider to determine if a node has been deleted in the cloud after it stops responding
- Route controller : For setting up routes in the underlying cloud infrastructure
- Service controller : Fore creating, updating and deleting cloud provider load balancers
